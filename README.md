# M101J: MongoDB for Java developers
Exercises for class M101J (MongoDB for Java developers) of MongoDB university.

This repository is organized into 7 folders. Each folder represents a week of class and has a different topic. In each folder you will find the following:

 - A zip file with the week's handouts and other courseware material.
 - A batch script called setup_db.bat which will import the databases/collections used for the weekly exercises. In order to work, this script assumes that you already have a MongoDB instance running on localhost and that you have the MongoDB bin folder on system path and that the handouts zip has been unzipped on the same folder of the script.
 - One or more javascript files which contains both the problem statement and the solution of the homeworks. Only homeworks that require the use of Mongo shell are present. You can test the solution passing the javascript file as an argument when opening the Mongo shell.

In addition to the weekly homeworks, there are 2 additional folders: one containing the blog built with Mongo, which is the main focus of this class, and one containing the final exam.
