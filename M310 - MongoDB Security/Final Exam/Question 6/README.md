# Problem
Which of the following statements is/are true?

Check all that apply:
 - Internal authentication via X.509 certificates will enable MongoDB's role-based access control authorization system.
 - The localhost exception applies to a replica set or sharded cluster environment.
 - Audit logs can go to one of four locations: the system log, the console, to another MongoDB member, or to a file.
 - Encryption at rest is a four step process: generate a master key, generate keys for each database, encrypt each database with the database keys, and encrypt the database keys with the master key.
 - When you enable encryption at rest, transport encryption between replicating members is automatically enabled.
