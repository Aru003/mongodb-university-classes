# Problem
Which of the following statements is/are true?

Check all that apply:
 - The subject of a client certificate acts as the "user" when authenticating with X.509 certificates.
 - The preferSSL SSL mode allows the server to accept both TLS and non-TLS connections between both clients and other members.
 - When enabling internal authentication between the members of a replica set both certificate and key must be present in the CA, client, and server PEM files.
 - MongoDB stores user-defined role information in the system.roles collection in the admin database.
 - When auditing is enabled on MongoDB Enterprise, the --auditFormat BSON option has much better performance than the --auditFormat JSON option.
